# ASP Chat (without the refresh) XMLHttp

Hi this is my first ASP code, hope you like it. The chat has some impressive features, especialy for an ONLINE chat that DOES NOT refresh the user. It has an active user list, see who is on and when they leave. You can also use over 48 smileys. The code also has a very good looking scroll to it when the message window needs to scroll. It stores all information for later use, but everytime a user loggs on it only loads a small amount (so the pages load faster). REMEMBER TO VOTE IF YOU LIKE THIS CODE. Im still developing it (its the first time ive done anything like this) Thanx everyone ^_^
